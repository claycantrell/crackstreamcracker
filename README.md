# Stream Iframe Extractor

**Educational Tool for Learning Web Scraping & Iframe Analysis**

A local web application that demonstrates how to analyze and extract embedded iframe players from web pages using Python, Selenium, and BeautifulSoup.

**FOR EDUCATIONAL AND RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY**

This tool is designed to teach web scraping techniques, iframe extraction, and client-side security concepts. Users must:
- Only analyze content they own or have permission to access
- Comply with all applicable copyright laws and website terms of service
- Not use this tool to circumvent DRM or access control measures
- Understand they are responsible for their own usage

This tool does **not** host, store, or distribute any content‚Äîit only analyzes webpage structure.

## Features

- üîç Analyze webpage structure to find embedded iframes
- üé¨ Extract multiple stream player options from a page
- üõ°Ô∏è Built-in popup blocker and security features
- üé® Clean, modern UI with gradient design
- üìä Display iframe metadata and technical information
- üîß JavaScript-rendered content support via Selenium

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Chrome browser (for Selenium)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd crackstreamcracker
```

2. **Create virtual environment:**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Mac/Linux
# OR
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
```

3. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Start the Flask server:**
```bash
python app.py
```

2. **Open your browser:**
Navigate to: `http://localhost:5001`

3. **Analyze a webpage:**
   - Enter any webpage URL containing embedded iframe players
   - Click "Analyze Page" to extract technical details
   - Review iframe sources, dimensions, and metadata

4. **View results:**
   - See all detected iframes with labels (player, chat, ads)
   - Technical info: dimensions, sandbox attributes, sources
   - Option to open iframes in new tabs for testing

## How It Works (Educational Overview)

This tool demonstrates several web scraping concepts:

1. **HTTP Requests**: Fetches webpage HTML using Python's `requests` library
2. **JavaScript Rendering**: Uses Selenium WebDriver to render JavaScript-heavy pages
3. **DOM Parsing**: BeautifulSoup parses HTML to find iframe elements
4. **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies different types of iframes (players vs ads vs chat)
5. **Metadata Extraction**: Extracts iframe attributes (src, dimensions, sandbox rules)
6. **Client-Side Security**: Implements popup blocking and security best practices

### Technical Flow

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3.8+, Flask
- **Web Scraping**: Selenium WebDriver, BeautifulSoup4, html5lib
- **Browser Automation**: ChromeDriver (via webdriver-manager)
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
- **Security**: Sandboxed iframes, popup blocking, referrer policies

## Learning Objectives

This project teaches:
- ‚úÖ Web scraping with Python
- ‚úÖ Handling JavaScript-rendered content with Selenium
- ‚úÖ HTML parsing with BeautifulSoup
- ‚úÖ RESTful API design with Flask
- ‚úÖ Client-side security best practices
- ‚úÖ Cross-origin restrictions (CORS, Same-Origin Policy)
- ‚úÖ Iframe sandboxing and permissions

## Limitations & Considerations

- **Same-Origin Policy**: Cannot modify cross-origin iframe content
- **Dynamic Content**: Some sites use WebSocket/WebRTC that can't be easily extracted
- **Anti-Scraping**: Many sites have protections against automated access
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect robots.txt and rate limits
- **Legal**: Only use on content you have permission to analyze
